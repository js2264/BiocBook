`r intro`

`BiocBook`s are **package-based, versioned online books** with a **supporting
`Docker` image** for each book version. 

A `BiocBook` can be created by authors (e.g. `R` developers, but also scientists, teachers, communicators, ...) who wish to: 

1. *Write*: compile a **body of biological and/or bioinformatics knowledge**;
2. *Containerize*: provide **Docker images** to reproduce the examples illustrated in the compendium;
3. *Publish*: deploy an **online book** to disseminate the compendium; 
4. *Versionize*: **automatically** generate specific online book versions and Docker images for specific [Bioconductor releases](https://contributions.bioconductor.org/use-devel.html).

A `BiocBook`-based package in Bioconductor `devel` or release `X.Y` (i.e. with a branch named `RELEASE_X_Y`) provides: 

- A **Docker image**: hosted on [ghcr.io](https://github.com/features/packages);
- A **`BiocBook` online book (a.k.a website)**: hosted on the repository `gh-pages` branch;

Both are built against the specific Bioconductor release `X.Y`.

# What is this `BiocBook` package? {-}

The [`BiocBook` **package**](https://github.com/js2264/BiocBook) 
offers a streamlined approach to creating `BiocBook`s, 
with several important benefits: 

- The author creates a `BiocBook`-based package without leaving R;
- The author writes book chapters in `pages/*.qmd` files using enhanced markdown; 
- The author can submit its `BiocBook`-based package to Bioconductor.

The containerization and publishing of the new `BiocBook`-based package is automated:

- Github Action workflow generates different Docker images for different Bioconductor releases, with the packages used in the book pre-installed;
- A Github Action workflow publishes different book versions for different Bioconductor releases.

# Main features of `BiocBook`s {-}

## Automated versioning of Docker images {-}

A separate Docker image is built for each branch (named `devel` or `RELEASE_X_Y`) 
of a `BiocBook`-based Github repository.  

Each Docker image provides pre-installed `R` packages: 

- Bioconductor release `X.Y`;
- Specific book dependencies from Bioconductor release `X.Y` (listed in `DESCRIPTION`);
- The book package itself

The Docker images also include a `micromamba`-based environment, named `BiocBook`, 
in which all the softwares listed in `requirements.yml` are installed. 

For example, `Docker` images built from this `BiocBook` package repository are available here: 

👉 [ghcr.io/js2264/biocbook](https://ghcr.io/js2264/biocbook) 🐳

### Get started now 🎉

You can get access to all the packages used in this book in < 1 minute, 
using this command in a terminal: 

```{sh "docker", filename="bash"}
#| eval: false
docker run -it ghcr.io/js2264/biocbook:devel R
```

## Automated versioning of the online book {-}

A separate online book version is published for each branch (named `devel` or `RELEASE_X_Y`) of a `BiocBook`-based Github repository.  

For example, the online book version matching the `devel` version of this `BiocBook` package is available from: 

👉 [http://js2264.github.io/BiocBook/devel/](http://js2264.github.io/BiocBook/devel/) 📘

# RStudio Server {-}

An RStudio Server instance based on a specific Bioconductor `<version>` (`devel` or `RELEASE_X_Y`) 
can be initiated from the corresponding `Docker` image as follows: 

```{sh "rstudio", filename="bash"}
#| eval: false
docker run \
    --volume <local_folder>:<destination_folder> \
    -e PASSWORD=OHCA \
    -p 8787:8787 \
    ghcr.io/<github_user>/<biocbook_repo>:<version>
```

The initiated RStudio Server instance will be available at 
[https://localhost:8787](https://localhost:8787).

Further instructions regarding Bioconductor-based Docker images are 
available [here](https://bioconductor.org/help/docker/).
